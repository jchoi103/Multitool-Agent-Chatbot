Its construction consists of multiple conductors of stranded soft annealed uncoated copper with PVC and nylon insulation. Each conductor is color coded for easy and quick recognition. The insulated conductors are cabled together in a suitable lay with a mylar tape wrapped helically over the assembly. A corrugated or flat specially coated aluminum shield is bonded to a polyethylene outer jacket, with the inner side uncoated in order to make contact with the drain wire. The shielded drain is 16 AWG 7 strand T/C drain wire inserted under the aluminum shield for termination and grounding. The outer jacket is a minimum .050 inch thick sunlight resistant polyethylene cover which averages .750 inch outside diameter.",,,taxable,,TRUE,1000,,0,0,525,12000,,,1,,,10,"Electrical, Electrical > Cable & Accessories",,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,default,http://localhost:5173/product/7?variant=200060,
