It is designed to supply power to motors or for connection to other power devices. Rated for 600 volts, 90\u00b0 C dry and 75\u00b0 C wet, it is specifically approved for direct burial, wet or dry locations, and outdoor in cable trays where a sunlight resistant rating is required. It is constructed of bare soft annealed stranded copper with high dielectric PVC insulation covering the individual conductors. The individual conductors are assembled round with PVC fillers added as needed. A tape binder is applied over the assembly, then it is covered with an overall PVC jacket.\n\n|Part No.|AWG Size|Ground|Lbs. / 1000'|Put-Ups|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|305122|#12/3|#12|128|5000' or CTL|\n|305202|#10/3|#10|198|5000' or CTL|\n|305302|#8|#10|282|5000' or CTL|\n|305402|#6|#8|417|4000' or CTL|\n|305502|#4|#8|604|3000' or CTL|\n|305602|#2|#6|940|2000' or CTL|\n|305615|#1|#6|1193|1000' or CTL|\n|305702|#1/0|#6|1442|1000' or CTL|\n|305802|#2/0|#6|1731|1000' or CTL|\n|305902|#3/0|#4|2159|1000' or CTL|\n|305942|#4/0|#4|2617|1000' or CTL|\n\n# MULTI CONDUCTOR CABLE\n\n# UF/NMC-B (KILL WIRE)\n\nThis copper cable is normally used for underground feeder or branch circuit wiring for installation above or below ground, including direct burial, and in wet or corrosive locations. It is constructed of solid, annealed bare copper, having PVC insulation and a sunlight resistant PVC overall jacket. It may be purchased by the foot, or per 5,000 ft. spool.

This copper cable has a wide variety of applications requiring flexibility and mechanical toughness, some of which include push button remote controls, industrial equipment, lighting, battery chargers, welding leads, power extensions, mining applications, and it's suitable and approved for submersion in water. Its flexible and tough jacket offers excellent abrasion, ozone, sunlight, chemical and oil resistance as well as being water and mold resistant. It is lightweight, long lasting, easy to carry and easy to handle. It is black in color, rated for 600 volts and operates between -40\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C temperature extremes. The color coded conductors provide easy identification.\n\n|Part No.|AWG Size|No. Conductors|Lbs. / 1000'|Put-Ups|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|55-88-99-05|#14|3|174|500'|\n|55-81-02-05|#14|4|210|500'|\n|55-80-94-05|#12|3|232|500'|\n|55-80-95-05|#12|4|281|500'|\n|55-80-97-05|#10|3|301|Please Call|\n|55-80-96-05|#10|4|363|for Pricing|\n|55-80-88-05|#8|3|477|500'|\n|55-80-93-05|#8|4|616|500'|\n\nWISH (303)364-0777\n\nWISH NEBRASKA (402)549-2181\n\nWISH NW (208)232-0644 / KENNEWICK, WA(509)582-7592",
